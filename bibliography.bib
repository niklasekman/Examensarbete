  title     = "Influence of the Testing Gage Length on the Strength, Young's

  abstract  = "Carbon fibres and glass fibres are reinforcements for advanced
               composites and the fiber strength is the most influential factor
               on the strength of the composites. They are essentially brittle
               and fail with very little reduction in cross section. Composites
               made with these fibres are characterized by a high
               strength/density ratio and their properties are intrisically
               related to their microstructure, i.e., amount and orientation of
               the fibres, surface treatment, among other factors. Processing
               parameters have an important role in the fibre mechanical
               behaviour (strength and modulus). Cracks, voids and impurities
               in the case of glass fibres and fibrillar misalignments in the
               case of carbon fibres are created during processing. Such
               inhomogeneities give rise to an appreciable scatter in
               properties. The most used statistical tool that deals with this
               characteristic variability in properties is the Weibull
               distribution. The present work investigates the influence of the
               testing gage length on the strength, Young's modulus and Weibull
               modulus of carbon fibres and glass fibres. The Young's modulus
               is calculated by two methods: (i) ASTM D 3379M, and (ii)
               interaction between testing equipment/specimen The first method
               resulted in a Young modulus of 183 GPa for carbon fibre, and 76
               GPa for glass fibre. The second method gave a Young modulus of
               250 GPa for carbon fibre and 50 GPa for glass fibre. These
               differences revelead differences on how the interaction
               specimen/testing machine can interfere in the Young modulus
               calculations. Weibull modulus can be a tool to evaluate the
               fibre's homogeneity in terms of properties and it is a good
               quality control parameter during processing. In the range of
               specimen gage length tested the Weibull modulus for carbon fibre
               is ~ 3.30 and for glass fibres is ~ 5.65, which indicates that
               for the batch of fibres tested, the glass fibre is more uniform
               in properties.",

               of a 420 sailboat mast during sailing: this type of data is of
               great interest in the structural design of sailboat masts and
               hulls as well as in the sail-making. The work involved the
               design, calibration and installation of strain gauge bridges at
               seven sections of an instrumented mast and at the shrouds: this
               was followed by the collection of strain data during simulated
               laboratory rigging tests and real sailing sessions with
               medium/strong wind. Compression loads at the mast step were
               recorded with a customised load cell calibrated on a force
               platform. On the basis of laboratory calibration constants, the
               strain measurements were converted into structural loads and
               averaged over steady states during rigging and sailing either
               close to the wind or beam reach: the longitudinal bending
               moment, the lateral bending moment and the axial loads were
               analysed and plotted along the 6.20?m mast length. Highest
               values of lateral bending (146?$\pm$?14.5?Nm) were recorded at
               the mast head, whereas longitudinal bending showed highest
               values at the vang connection to the mast (229?$\pm$?29?Nm).
               Tension loads acting on the shrouds were also measured with
               highest values of 2887?$\pm$?167?N. The knowledge of loads
               acting along the mast will support the designers in improving
               the mast?s cross section profile, the material selection and the
               validation of numerical structural analysis. Moreover,
               experimental data about the loads acting on the standing rigging
               and on the mast-step during sailing will support the optimised
               design of the boat shell.",

               propelled marine drone for a sustainable monitoring of wide sea
               areas. In particular, sail propulsion assures a near to infinite
               autonomy since limited energy demand of on board electronic can
               be assured by renewable sources such as solar cells. However, to
               correctly manage a sail system, a correct estimation of wind
               intensity and its direction is essential. Conventional
               anemometers make use of delicate mechanical moving parts, are
               therefore not suitable to work autonomously in difficult
               environments such as the marine one. Commercial ultrasonic

               sail is the key for its motion. Wing sail is composed of

               high-efficiency airfoil is selected. After that, overturning

               the size of the wing sail. At last, the wing sail is
               manufactured and checked, and it is tested by start wind speed
               experiments, running speed experiments, steering motion, and
               obstacle avoidance experiments. The minimum start wind speed is

                     knots. Using this relation the required wind speed at the
                     four boat speeds can be expressed as a function of heel
                     only. The heel angle corresponding to the smallest wind
                     speed is the best. Knowing this, and the corresponding
                     optimum trim, the position of the sailor is computed. It
                     turns out that the predicted best positions correspond
                     well with practical experience. However, the results
                     highlight the benefit of a small heel in higher winds,
                     which often is regarded as undesired by sailors.",

  abstract  = "The maritime industry, among all other industries, is being
               forced to gradually reduce its emissions. Legislation is one of
               the tools applying this pressure, and from 1 January 2020, it
               focuses on the reduction of sulfur percentage in the heavy fuel
               oil (HFO)-powered vessels to 0.5\%. In the beginning of this
               paper, the harmful environmental contribution of the naval
               sector is presented, along with the current legislation. The
               maritime industry is in a transitional stage, diverging from
               fossil fuels through alternative technologies and fuels, aiming
               to become over the long term a zero-emission industry. However,
               there are many implemented technologies, mostly of a mechanical
               nature, that already improve the efficiency of vessels and
               indirectly reduce their emissions. Such technologies include
               shaft generators (SGs), scrubbers, etc. The aim is for
               alternative fuels and technologies such as solar and wind to be
               implemented, too. Such technologies, when combined with the
               advantages of digitalization and automation, can further reduce
               emissions toward zero-emission vessels (ZEVs) through integrated
               systems. The present paper serves the purpose of a common point
               of gathering, addressing, and explaining the latest updates,
               previous achievements, and future targets of the maritime
               sector. The very nature of the subject---electric propulsion in
               the maritime sector---makes it very difficult to find sufficient
               and trustworthy data. There are two main reasons for this
               problem. The first one is that electric vehicles became
               commercial at a large scale (electric cars) very recently, and
               are still in a transitional stage. The second reason is that the
               maritime industry is very competitive; therefore,
               state-of-the-art technologies and data that give each company
               the lead are rarely published, and when they do, it happens very
               discreetly. In the quantitative part of the paper, where the
               photovoltaic (PV) and battery system calculations take place,
               there is no use of a specific model rather than a simplified
               approach. The purpose of the calculations is to show that with
               the present technologies, a purely solar-powered commercial
               vessel (such as RoRo, passenger, etc.) is technically
               impossible, and that there could be only a small
               contribution---of around 7\%---to the electricity needs of a
               roll-on/roll-off (RoRo)-passenger ship. The state of the art
               finds a very short number of vessels that already use battery
               propulsion, but is expected to increase in the upcoming years.
               The present paper not only presents an overview of the
               state-of-the-art achievements in the electric propulsion of
               vessels, it also considers the exploitation of the continuous
               growth that the battery market is facing. As stated before,
               batteries are on the up, and this is due to the emerging need
               for energy storage in electricity grids that depend increasingly
               on renewable energy sources (RES). The paper makes a first
               consideration about the feasibility and possible benefits of
               implementing grid-like battery systems on-board vessels. In such
               a scenario, vessels would acquire significantly bigger energy
               capacity, allowing greater travel distances, a possible
               contribution of 44\% of the vessel's total power requirements
               (propulsion included), and a surplus as far as electricity
               requirements are concerned. There is also the more futuristic
               long-term scenario where Green Ports would charge vessels purely
               from RES dedicated to the port's needs. The last part of the
               paper contains a qualitative assessment about the possible
               impacts that a battery-powered maritime industry could have.",

              tracking capability of autonomous sailing monohulls during marine
              science missions. Considering that the design of the hull and
              keel of an autonomous sailing monohull is usually a
              task-orientated and creative process, estimating speed
              performance by traditional velocity prediction programs (VPPs)
              based on empirical formulas and gradient solvers will lead to
              errors. This paper proposes a generalized VPP for helping
              designers assess the speed performance of their autonomous
              sailing monohulls. We designed an enhanced genetic algorithm (GA)
              solver to help the VPP converge quickly without a priori

              neighbourhood information-based optimization (NIBO) strategy to
              accelerate and refine the solutions using adjacent states
              (external conditions with the same true wind speed (TWS) or true
              wind angle (TWA)) instead of culminating prediction by solving
              each state independently. We provide an application of the
              proposed VPP on our prototype as an example. Moreover, the
              numerical and experimental results show that the proposed VPP can

               from wingsails, called the sail-induced resistance. A cargo ship
               is tested with varying speed, appendages, number of sails, and
               control algorithms for the sails. The appendages consist of
               bilge keels, a high aspect ratio fixed keel, and a dynamically
               controlled keel. The sails were controlled both to maximize the
               thrust and to iteratively optimize the angle of attack including
               hydrodynamic effects. The physical modelling is a done with a
               combination of CFD, maneuvering theory, discrete lifting line,
               and empirical models. The magnitude of the sail-induced
               resistance was found to be comparable to the added resistance in
               waves. The main source of the resistance was the rudder, which
               was forced to operate at large angles in steady state
               conditions. Adding the appendages reduced the sail-induced
               resistance, but the fixed appendages also increased the
               friction. The dynamic keel was therefore the only appendage that
               significantly improved the fuel savings. The side force from the
               sails could be significantly reduced with limits in the control
               algorithm. Although this limit also reduced the thrust from the
               sails, the fuel savings remained high due to a roughly equal
               reduction in the sail-induced resistance.",
